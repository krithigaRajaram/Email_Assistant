Hi Sarah,

I've reviewed the budget proposal for the new server infrastructure. The numbers look good, and I'm approving the $45,000 budget for the hardware purchases.

Please proceed with the vendor selection process. Let's aim to have everything ordered by end of November.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: Quick Question about API Documentation

Hey Sarah,

Quick question - do you know where I can find the latest API documentation for our customer portal? I need to integrate the new payment gateway but can't locate the current docs.

Also, are you free for a quick call tomorrow around 3 PM to discuss this?

Thanks,
John
